# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [Android Architecture Components: Lifecycle and LiveModel][published url]
## Instructor: [Tin Megali][instructor url]


In the last part of this series, Introduction to Android Architecture Components, we talked about the new Android Architecture and why it was developed. Basically, the new architecture addresses some known Android issues by offering a bundle of components tailor-made for the system. These are the building blocks of the architecture. We've already had a quick look at these components, so now it is time to start to deep dive into them. 

In this tutorial, we'll take a close look at the Lifecycle and the LiveModel components. While we're exploring these, we're also going to check out some code snippets from a sample application. Since we're talking about Android's new paradigms, the snippets are all made with the awesome Kotlin.
